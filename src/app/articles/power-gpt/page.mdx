This project, Power GPT, is a full stack application that leverages the power of GPT models to provide a rich conversational experience but with additional features focused on the power user. It's built with React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend.

## Overview

The application is divided into two main parts: the client and the server. The client is built with React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, and the server is built with Node.js and Express for the backend.

### Client

The client side of the application is built with React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses Vite as a build tool, which provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

The client side also uses Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for highly customizable designs without leaving your HTML.

The client side code is organized into several directories:

- `api`: Contains the API calls to the server.
- `assets`: Contains static files like images.
- `components`: Contains reusable React components.
- `context`: Contains React context providers for state management.
- `layout`: Contains layout components.
- `pages`: Contains the main page components.
- `utils`: Contains utility functions.

### Server

The server side of the application is built with Node.js and Express, a minimalist web framework for Node.js.

The server side code is organized into several directories:

- `controllers`: Contains the logic for handling requests.
- `middleware`: Contains middleware functions for handling requests.
- `models`: Contains the data models for the application.
- `routes`: Contains the routes for the application.

The server uses JWT for authentication and WebSocket for real-time communication.

## Code Example

Here's an example of how the server handles WebSocket connections:

```javascript
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

wss.on('connection', function connection(ws, req) {
    const token = req.url.split('userId=')[1];
    try {
        const decoded = verifyTokenSync(token);
        ws.user = decoded.user;

        ws.on('message', function incoming(message) {
            console.log('received: %s', message);
            completeChatStream({ ws, message, WebSocket });
        });

        ws.on('close', () => console.log('Client has disconnected'));
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle error
    }
```
